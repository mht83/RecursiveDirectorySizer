# Recursive Directory Sizer

## Overview
The Recursive Directory Sizer is a C++ utility that calculates the total size of a directory, including all subdirectories and files contained within. It provides an option to follow symbolic links during the size calculation.

## Features
- **Recursive Calculation**: Traverses all subdirectories to calculate the total size.
- **Symbolic Link Handling**: Option to include or exclude the sizes of files pointed to by symbolic links.
- **Cross-Platform**: Utilizes the C++17 `filesystem` library, making it compatible with various operating systems.

## Prerequisites
- C++17 compliant compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Standard C++17 Library

## Usage
Compile the source code with a C++17 compliant compiler. Run the executable and follow the prompts to enter the directory path and whether to follow symbolic links.
